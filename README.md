## Different scripts for cryptographic implementation

Used  [des_tools such as s_box and IP ](https://github.com/dkushagra/DES-Python ).

Implementing DES algorithm 

plain='0123456789ABCDEF'

key='133457799BBCDFF1'

cipher='85E813540F0AB405'


### Though its aimed I will try to optimize it by applying modifications
