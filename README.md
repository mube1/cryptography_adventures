## Different scripts for cryptographic implementation

Used des_tools from https://github.com/dkushagra/DES-Python to access fixed s-box and permutation constants

Implementing DES algorithm 

plain='0123456789ABCDEF'

key='133457799BBCDFF1'

cipher='85E813540F0AB405'


### Though its aimed I will try to optimize it by applying modifications
